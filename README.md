# Codewars Repository

This repository contains my solutions to katas (coding problems) that I practice daily to strengthen my JavaScript skills. 

The katas are categorized by kyu (level of difficulty), kyu 8 being the easiest, and kyu 1 the hardest.

## Lessons Learned:

In each kata, I like to include other user's solutions that I found clever or well-optimized, to learn new ways I can improve my implementation or new methods I wasn't familiar with and could be useful in the future.

Other than the algorithms and methods specific to each kata, there are also two main takeaways for me:

· *There is (almost) always some way to improve*: 

Although sometimes a naive implementation is enough, searching for other people's code or learning about the type of problem we are trying to solve can help us write better code and better solutions.

· *Styling matters*: 

It is difficult to understand someone else's code when they haven't put thought into the structure or variable names. I try to make my solutions as readable as possible by using relevant names and maintaining visual clearness.
