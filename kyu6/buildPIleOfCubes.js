// 6 kyu
// Build a pile of Cubes
// JavaScript:

// Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of n^3, the cube above will have volume of (nâˆ’1)^3 and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1^3.

// You are given the total volume m of the building. Being given m can you find the number n of cubes you will have to build?

// The parameter of the function findNb will be an integer m and you have to return the integer n such as n^3 + (n-1)^3 + (n-2)^3 + ... + 1^3 = m if such a n exists or -1 if there is no such n.

// findNb(1071225) --> 45

// findNb(91716553919377) --> -1

function findNb(m) {
  let tempVolume = 0;
  let lastCube = 0;

  for (let i = 1; tempVolume < m; i++) {
    tempVolume += i * i * i;
    lastCube = i;
  }

  return tempVolume === m ? lastCube : -1;
}
