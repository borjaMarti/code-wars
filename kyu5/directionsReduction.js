// 5 kyu
// Directions Reduction
// JavaScript:

// Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild mountainous west,…

// … a man was given directions to go from one point to another. The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST". Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too.

// Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction right away is a needless effort. Since this is the wild west, with dreadful weather and not much water, it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!
// How I crossed a mountainous desert the smart way.

// The directions given to the man are, for example, the following (depending on the language):

// ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"].
// or
// { "NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST" };
// or
// [North, South, South, East, West, North, West]

// You can immediately see that going "NORTH" and immediately "SOUTH" is not reasonable, better stay to the same place! So the task is to give to the man a simplified version of the plan. A better plan in this case is simply:

// ["WEST"]
// or
// { "WEST" }
// or
// [West]

// In ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST"], the direction "NORTH" + "SOUTH" is going north and coming back right away.

// The path becomes ["EAST", "WEST"], now "EAST" and "WEST" annihilate each other, therefore, the final result is [] (nil in Clojure).

// In ["NORTH", "EAST", "WEST", "SOUTH", "WEST", "WEST"], "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are not directly opposite but they become directly opposite after the reduction of "EAST" and "WEST" so the whole path is reducible to ["WEST", "WEST"].

// Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).

//  · Not all paths can be made simpler. The path ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"] is not reducible. "NORTH" and "WEST", "WEST" and "SOUTH", "SOUTH" and "EAST" are not directly opposite of each other and can't become such. Hence the result path is itself : ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"].

function dirReduc(arr) {
    let directions = [];
    let opposites = {
        'NORTH': 'SOUTH',
        'SOUTH': 'NORTH',
        'EAST': 'WEST',
        'WEST': 'EAST'
    };

    arr.forEach( (elem) => {
        if (directions[directions.length - 1] === opposites[elem]) directions.pop();
        else directions.push(elem);
    });

    return directions;
}

// Super happy with my implementation!! 
// Could have returned the iteration directly by using reduce, but otherwise pretty clean:

// return arr.reduce( (acc, elem) => {
//     if (acc[acc.length - 1] === opposites[elem]) acc.pop();
//     else acc.push(elem);
// }, []);
